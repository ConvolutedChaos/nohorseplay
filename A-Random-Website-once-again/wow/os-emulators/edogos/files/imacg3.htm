        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iMac G3, originally released as the iMac, is a series of Macintosh personal<br>
        computers sold by Apple Computer from 1998 to 2003. The iMac was the first major new product release<br>
        for Apple under Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO and cofounder, who returned to the financially troubled<br>
        company in 1996 after eleven years away. Jobs reorganized the company and simplified the product<br>
        line; the iMac was designed as Apple's new consumer desktop product, a cheaper computer for average<br>
        consumers that would easily connect to the internet.<br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iMac's all-in-one design is based around a cathode ray tube display, with the computer's
        PowerPC<br>
        G3 processor, components, and connectivity included in the same enclosure. Head of design Jony Ive<br>
        and his team developed a teardrop-shaped, translucent plastic case for the iMac, a radical departure<br>
        from the look of previous personal computers. They developed new work methodologies to finish the<br>
        computer in an accelerated timeframe, and created new workflows they would use for designing<br>
        products going forward. The iMac eschewed legacy technologies like serial ports and floppy disk<br>
        drives for CD-ROMs and USB ports.<br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critical response to the iMac was mixed; journalists thought the machine would be good for
        new<br>
        users, but bemoaned the lack of legacy technology, or felt the mouse and keyboard were<br>
        uncomfortable. The iMac was an immediate commercial success, becoming Apple's fastest-selling<br>
        computer and selling more than 5 million units in its lifetime. The original model was revised<br>
        several times, increasing the processor speed, memory, hard drive space, and other capabilities. The<br>
        iMac is credited with saving Apple from financial ruin, and for turning computers from niche,<br>
        technical products to mass consumer fashion. The translucent plastic look was appropriated by other<br>
        computers and consumer products, leading to legal action from Apple. The G3-based model was<br>
        eventually replaced by a G4-powered successor, while the iMac G3's role in education markets would<br>
        be replaced by the eMac.<br>
