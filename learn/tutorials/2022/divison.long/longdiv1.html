	<p>
		(Ok, beware. I spent a long time on this.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Ok, let's start. Let's say, uh, Billy and his friends made some cookies.
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		Billy and his friends made 8192 cookies altogether and they were going to give them to the bakeries downtown.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		There are 8 bakeries downtown. How many cookies will each bakery get?
	</p>
	<br>
	Ok, so first we have to divide <b>8192</b> by <b>8</b>. So, usually you would write it out like <b><i>this:</i></b>
	<br>
	<img src="/img/assets/learning/longdiv/longdiv1.gif">
	<br>
	<p>
		Now, how many times can <b>8</b> go into <b>8</b>?
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
	    <b>1</b>.
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		So, we write "1" above the second "8", like <b><i>this:</i></b> 
	</p>
	<br>
	<img src="/img/assets/learning/longdiv/longdiv2.gif">
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		Now, whats <b>8 x 1</b>? Well, the answer is probably 8. So, we write "8" underneath the second "8", like <b><i>this:</i></b>
	</p>
	<br>
	<img src="/img/assets/learning/longdiv/longdiv3.gif">
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		Well, the way I learned it, now you add the subtraction algorithm, like <b><i>this:</i></b>
	</p>
	<br>
	<img src="/img/assets/learning/longdiv/longdiv4.gif">
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		Ok, what's <b>8</b> minus <b>8</b>? The answer is 0. Now, you complete the subtraction algorithm by putting "0" under the third "8", like <b><i>this:</i></b>
	</p>
	<br>
	<img src="/img/assets/learning/longdiv/longdiv5.gif">
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		Now, you want to carry the one down next to your zero, like <b><i>this:</i></b>
	</p>
	<br>
	<img src="/img/assets/learning/longdiv/longdiv6.gif">
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		Now, how many times can <b>8</b> go into <b>1</b>? 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>0.</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		So you write the "0" under the "1" you just created, like <b><i>this:</i></b>
	</p>
	<br>
	<img src="/img/assets/learning/longdiv/longdiv7.gif">
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		Then, once again, you add the subtraction algorithm to <b><i>that</i></b>.
	</p>
	<br>
	<img src="/img/assets/learning/longdiv/longdiv8.gif">
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
	    Now, what's 1 minus 0? <b>1</b>. So to complete the subtraction algorithm you put a "1" as the answer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like <b><i>this:</i></b>
	</p>
	<br>
	<img src="/img/assets/learning/longdiv/longdiv9.gif">
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		Well, we're around halfway there.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, we gotta carry the <b>9</b> just like we carried the <b>1</b>, sort of like <b><i>this:</i></b>. You can also draw arrows to show the carryings of the numbers.
	</p>
