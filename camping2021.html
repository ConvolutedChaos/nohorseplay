    <p>Bright and early Monday morning, I helped Grandma and Grandpa load the camper with all manner of camping essentials, such as food, water, and lawn chairs. A little bit after that, we left. Instead of going to the Calamus Reservoir State Recreation and Wildlife Management Area, we had to go to Johnson Lake because the Calamus had "Toxic Algae Blooms" in the water. But Johnson Lake was still good. Once we got to our camping spot, we had to back the camper into our camping site. Once that was out of the way, we unpacked our stuff. Then, we ate lunch, sat around for a little while. Then we walked over to the beach and played for a bit. Then we walked over to the camper, got our swim suits on, then crawled into the bed of the pickup. Grandpa and Grandma hopped into the pickup and we drove to the beach. Once we got to the beach, we unpacked our sand and water toys, put on our life jackets, and got into the water. We were in there for a LONG time!!!!!! Then we went back to the camper to wash the sand off of our legs and feet. (and by "wash off" I mean use the outside shower that's like NEVER used.) Then we ate supper and went to bed. It took me a while to fall asleep but I still slept good.

        The next morning I woke up and ate some cereal. But before I got a bowl out, I thought, "Maybe I should put the cereal in a cup" So I did. I took the cup of cereal and sat in bed while reading a book. Later, Grandpa woke up and told us, "Good morning!!" Then, he went back to bed. A few minutes later, he came back out and told me, "I am going to the bath house. Wanna come?" and I said, "Sure!" So I went with him to go the the bathroom. When we got back from the bathroom, Grandma was already awake. Later, we got out the boat, inflated the inner tube, (so-called "Big Mable") and went to the boat launch. This time I went on the inner tube. (because last year I was a baby!) It was fun. A lot of fun went by those few hours. But then we quit doing that and went to the beach. Aiden and Emily took the inner tube and they both sat on it and let themselves float away. (Luckily there was buoys surrounding the beach.) Then we went back to the camper and had a cookout. Then, instead of using the outside shower we went to the showerhouse. After that, we went to bed.

        Later, Grandpa woke up and told us, "Good morning!!" Then, he went back to bed. A few minutes later, he came back out and told me, "I am going to the bath house. Wanna come?" and I said, "Sure!" So I went with him to go the the bathroom. When we got back from the bathroom, Grandma was already awake. Then, we sat around for a little while. A little later, we drove to the boat launch. When the boat came off the trailer the boat started floating away. Then Grandma and Grandpa yelled to Aiden, "GRAB THE BOAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Aiden grabbed the boat, but the boat PULLED HIM IN!! Luckily, he had a life jacket on. Grandpa took off his shirt and jumped in. Then, he climbed into the boat and started it. We all climbed into the boat and we all drove away. Later, Grandma noticed that Grandpa's glasses were lost in the lake! But he could still see. Just not as well. Then we went tubing again. We did tubing for a LONG time! After that, we went to the beach. We played for a little bit, But then there was some nasty storm clouds rolling in so we had to go back to the camper. On the radar green means: "Hey, look! it's sprinkling!" yellow means: "Hey, look! it's raining kind of hard!" red means: "Hey, look! it's thundering!" and purple means: "Hey, look! W A T C H &nbsp; O U T ! !" Luckily, the purple cloud went around us so we only got a little rain. Grandpa, Emily and Aiden all went to the shower house to take showers. Once they all came back we all ate supper. Then we watched a movie called "Luca" and then we all went to bed.
