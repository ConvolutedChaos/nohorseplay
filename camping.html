	<p>Ok, <b>beware</b>. This is very long, but I hope you like it.</p>
	<p>We're Here! wait, what? Well THAT didn't take long. I can't recall much that evening. 8:21 am the next morning (approximately), Grandma is making lunch. It consists of chicken, mushrooms, and maybe corn (from the field!). When she is in the middle of making lunch, Matt calls. After a short time, we hop in the pickup to go to Bassett, NE. Turned out our "lunch" was going to be supper. On the way there, we pass through Taylor (which is smaller then Sargent!). Grandma tells me that there is no town for at least 50 miles. 76.7 miles later, we arrive at the small town. Well what do you know? Matt, Drew, David, and Lizzie. Only David and Lizzie were able to come with us back to grandma's house. On the way back, Grandma said that we should go out for lunch. We were going to go straight to the Ritz, But Grandpa and Aiden weren't with us. I suggested their orders could just be takeout, but Grandpa wasn't answering his phone. So we went back to Grandma and Grandpa's, picked them up, but we couldn't use the car that we came home in (the new pickup), because there wasn't enough room. So Me and David sat in the far back, Lizzie and Grandma sat in the middle row, and Grandpa (being the driver) and Aiden sat in the front. We had to go to some hardware store, THEN the Ritz. We were just about to get ice cream when David discovered that there was a gumball machine. He also had a couple dollars and a quarter. He got a white one. He wanted a green one! He was going to get another one, but he didn't have any quarters left! But then he had the idea to trade some more in at the front counter. Guess what? IT WORKED! He gave me a quarter so I could have a gumball too. Well what do you know? I got a green one! I had to spit it out so I could eat my vanilla cone. That day everything was perfect; David, Lizzie, and I were playing in the sandbox, Grandma was watching us, and Aiden was helping Grandpa. Then we swam for an hour or two, then had ice pops, and then we hid in the closet under the basement stairs for a while, That evening, we had a Nerf war. Me and David versus Aiden. We won though. Before going to bed that night, I set an alarm scheduled for 7:15 am. It was going to be 6:30 or 6:45, but Grandma said nothing before 7:00. 7:15 it is, then. I usually wake up at around 7:15 anyway. I woke up at 6:50 am. Arrgh! I hate when I wake up shortly before my alarm goes off!! I didn't fall back asleep, though. RIINNNG! RIINNNG! RIINNNG! Slide to stop alarm. Hmm. *slide* *alarm stops* Then David put a shirt on, we crept down to the main floor, and we went downstairs and picked out a movie. Cloudy with a chance of meatballs. We were almost done watching when Grandpa and Lizzie woke up. Grandpa called us up to eat breakfast. Turned out we had TWO UNOPENED BOXES of Cinnamon Toast Crunch (which is like, my favorite cereal). After that we went back downstairs and watched the rest. I can't recall much that day. Now don't quote me on this, but I think we had another Nerf war that day. Next morning, Church. First stop, Opal's Apartment. Later, after the church service ended, we went to the Tumbleweed. We drop Opal off, done. That evening, we went to some Baptism. Monday: 10:00 am, we go to the lake, have a picnic lunch, then have a BLAST tubing. David needed his attitude flipped around, so he rode in the tube by himself. But then the inner tube flipped over! He was definitely cheerful after that! We tried to dump Aiden, but WE COULD NOT!! He even survived the figure 8! (‚àû) Then Me and David rode on the inner tube back to the beach. Lizzie played in the water, while Me and David dug on the side of the sand hill. Aiden even made a hole where you could go to the bathroom. After that, we boated back to the launch and put the boat back on the trailer and left. We stopped in Sargent to get ice cream from the Ritz, went back to the house, and I took a shower. After that, I finished packing, and then we went to Broken Bow to my mom's work. We then chatted a little bit, then Mom, Aiden, and I went home. Oh, and just a side note, at the time of finishing this story, it has been 48:55:43 (hr/min/sec) since I was last at Grandma's house!
